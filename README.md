## Udacity Front-End Web Developer - Arcade Game Project
This project was made to apply the technologies that I learned from the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Object Oriented JAvascript course.
The starter code which is a static, non-interactive version of the project has downloaded through  https://github.com/mehmeteminduran/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game and developed.

### Technologies used
- HTML
- JAVASCRIPT

### How to play
- Download application or clone repository
- Right click index.html and open with browser
- The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. 
- The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene.
- Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square.
- Once the player reaches the water the game is won.
